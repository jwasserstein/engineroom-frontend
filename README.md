Itâ€™s a single page, fullstack application that uses React and Redux on the frontend and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend. The frontend is served by GitHub Pages and the backend runs on Heroku with a managed database provided by MongoDB Atlas. It was designed using Figma.  This repository holds the frontend code.
