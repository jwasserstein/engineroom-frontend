# Todo
- Standardize all margins between blobs to either 15px or 20px.
- Add some hover effect to friend and car blurbs to indicate that they're clickable (translate, background color change, or box shadow change)
- Add a way to edit your profile: image, bio, name, etc.
- Replace outline on all form fields with box-shadow
- Add car page
- Add search functionality or some other way of finding other users that aren't suggested by <ExplorePage> or already on the feed
- Update layouts of <WallPage> and <FriendPage> to make them the same and not rely on width % and space-around
