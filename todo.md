# Todo
- Standardize all margins between blobs to either 15px or 20px.
- Verify responsiveness of all pages, including the middle-ground between desktop and mobile
- Ensure you can edit a profile with the default image
- Create dummy accounts that new users are friends with by default as a demo


## Right Now
- Deployment
- Add to portfolio

## Potential Expansion Ideas
- Add ability to delete and edit cars.  Add red X in top right corner to delete, pencil icon to edit.  Editing brings you back to the new car page with the fields pre-populated with the car's existing data.
- Add progress bar to image uploads for car and profile images.  They're kinda slow.
- Add search functionality or some other way of finding other users that aren't suggested by <ExplorePage> or already on the feed
- Add infinite scrolling
